## üöó**News**



- üöÄ[2024/01/04] We create this repository to maintain a paper list on LLM-based AI Agents. More papers are coming soon!



## ‚ù£Ô∏è Introduction

Artificial intelligence-agent (AI-Agent) is considered to be a promising method to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI), and researchers hope that AI-Agent can realize the automation and intelligence of geographic information science exploration tasks through its general automation capabilities.
