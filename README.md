## ‚ù£Ô∏è Introduction

Artificial intelligence-agent (AI-Agent) is considered to be a promising method to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI), 
and researchers hope that AI-Agent can realize the automation and intelligence of geographic information science exploration 
tasks through its general automation capabilities.

We propose a new architecture, Geo-JARVIS. It aims to automatically acquire geographic data through the form of AI-Agents 
and promote the development of new tools and new paradigms for geographic information science exploration and knowledge discovery. 
Geo-JARVIS is a humanoid agent that is understandable, memorable, plannable, and evolvable. 
From an abstract perspective, we define the four basic spaces that support Geo-JARVIS: instruction space, task space, 
model space, and data space, as well as its behavior space for task decomposition, 
task modeling, task planning, task calibration, and task combination that support basic spatial transformations.
